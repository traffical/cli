Auto-create project-scoped SDK key on init

`traffical init` now automatically creates a project-scoped SDK key (sdk:read, sdk:write) via the Management API and saves it to `.traffical/.env`. A `.traffical/.gitignore` is also created to ensure the key is never committed. Pass `--no-sdk-key` to skip this step.
